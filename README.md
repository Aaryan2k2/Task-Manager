# Todo App Monorepo

Welcome to the **Todo App Monorepo**, a full-stack application that includes a frontend built using React (Vite) and a backend API built with Django and Django REST framework. This app allows users to manage their todo lists with both frontend and backend features working seamlessly together.

## Project Structure

This monorepo is organized into two main directories:

```bash
├── client/                # React frontend built with Vite
└── server-django/         # Django REST API backend
    └── backend/
